        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I continue to streamline an arena-based paradigm, and stumbled
upon a concise technique for dynamic growth — an efficient, generic
“concatenate anything to anything” within an arena built atop a core of
9-ish lines of code. The key insight originated from a reader suggestion
about dynamic arrays. The subject of concatenation can be a string,
dynamic array, or even something else. The “system” is extensible, and
especially useful for path handling.
Continuing from last time, the examples are in light, C-style C++.
I chose it because templates and function overloading express the concepts
succinctly. It uses no standard library functionality, so converting to C,
or similar, should be straightforward. The core concatenation “operator”:

template<typename T>
T concat(arena *a, T head, T tail)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Occasionally we need to compute the size of an object that does not yet
exist, or a subscript that may fall out of bounds. It’s easy to miss
the edge cases where results overflow, creating a nasty, subtle bug, even
in the presence of type safety. Ideally such computations happen in
specialized code, such as inside an allocator (calloc, reallocarray)
and not outside by the allocatee (i.e. malloc). Mitigations exist with
different trade-offs: arbitrary precision, or using a wider fixed integer
— i.e. 128-bit integers on 64-bit hosts. In the typical case, working only
with fixed size-type integers, I’ve come up with a set of guidelines to
avoid overflows in the edge cases.
Range check before computing a result. No exceptions.
Do not cast unless you know a priori the operand is in range.
