        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A common operation in software is the copy of a block of memory. In C/C++, we often call the function memcpy for this purpose. But what happens if, while you are copying the data, another thread is modifying either the source or the destination? The result is fundamentally unpredictable and almost surely a programming error. … Continue reading Thread-safe memory copy]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fuzz testing is incredibly effective for mechanically discovering software
defects, yet remains underused and neglected. Pick any program that must
gracefully accept complex input, written in any language, which has not
yet been been fuzzed, and fuzz testing usually reveals at least one bug.
At least one program currently installed on your own computer certainly
qualifies. Perhaps even most of them. Everything is broken and
low-hanging fruit is everywhere. After fuzz testing ~1,000 projects over
the past six years, I’ve accumulated tips for picking that fruit.
The checklist format has worked well in the past (1, 2), so
I’ll use it again. This article discusses AFL++ on source-available
C and C++ targets, running on glibc-based Linux distributions, currently
the best fuzzing platform for C …]]></summary>

It comes four months after the 2.2.0 release and it contains 203 commits, bringing bugfixes and improvements.
If you’re still on Nim 1.6, take a look at the version 2.0 release article to see all the features you’re missing.
If you’ve been using Nim 2.0, the version 2.2 release article shows the improvements available in Nim 2.2.
Installing Nim 2.2.2
Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.2.2 or
install it as described here.
If you have installed a previous version of Nim using choosenim,
getting Nim 2.2.2 is as easy as:
$ choosenim update self
$ choosenim update stable

NOTE: Make sure that the version of choosenim you have installed is 0.8.5 or higher, ot…]]></summary>

Before we go into details, we would like to thank all the people who took the time to respond.
We really appreciate the feedback!
The goal of this survey was primarily to determine how our community is using Nim, in order to better understand how we should be improving it.
Do you use Nim?
Based on the answer to this question, the respondents were divided into two groups that each received a separate set of questions.

Approximately three quarters of the respondents use Nim (40% frequently, 36% occasionally), while the remaining quarter is divided between people who never used Nim (7%) and peop…]]></summary>

for std::unordered_map and std::vector equivalents in C programs. The
core, important features of these data structures require only a dozen or
so lines of code apiece. They compile quickly, and tend to run faster in
debug builds than release builds of their C++ equivalents. What they
lack in genericity they compensate in simplicity. Nothing here will be
new. Everything has been covered in greater detail previously, which I
will reference when appropriate.
For a concrete goal, we will build a data structure representing an
process environment, along with related functionality to make it more
interesting. That is, we’ll build a string-to-string map.
