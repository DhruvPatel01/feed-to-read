the latest Nim, version 2.0.4
LTS release, version 1.6.20
For the majority of our users, v2.0.4 contains 23 commits and brings bugfixes and improvements to Nim 2.0.2, released four months ago.
For those users who haven’t switched to Nim v2.0 yet, we have released the ninth patch release for Nim 1.6.x.
It is a small release with 13 commits.
Installing Nim 2.0.4
New users
Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.0.4 or
install it as described here.
Existing users
If you have installed a previous version of Nim using choosenim,
getting Nim 2.0.4 is as easy as:
$ choosenim 2.0.4

If you are on OSX ARM, choosenim will not work for you.
Please choose an alternative method of installing or updating.
Alternatively, you can …]]></summary>

oriented around C. I’m always looking for a better way, and lately I’ve
been experimenting with building them using C++ features. What are the
trade-offs? Are the benefits worth the costs? In this article I lay out my
goals, review implementation possibilities, and discuss my findings.
Following along will require familiarity with those previous two articles.
Some of C++ is beyond my mental capabilities, and so I cannot wield those
parts effectively. Other parts I can wrap my head around, but it
requires substantial effort and the inevitable mistakes are difficult to
debug. So a general goal is to minimize contact with that complexity, only
touching a few higher-value features that I can use confidently.
Existing practice is unimportant. …]]></summary>
