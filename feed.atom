Let me be clear that copies really are cheap. It is often more performant to copy that data than to track the same memory across different threads. … Continue reading Performance tip: avoid unnecessary copies]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nim team is happy to announce Nim version 2.0.6, our third, and the largest by far, patch release for Nim 2.0.
Version 2.0.6 contains (exactly!) 200 commits and brings bugfixes and improvements to Nim 2.0.4, released two months ago.
The reason for this many commits in this release is that this is planned as the last 2.0.x release before Nim 2.2 and we wanted to give you the best Nim 2.0 experience in case you won’t be able to switch immediately to Nim 2.2.
NOTE: If your program uses threads (--threads:on became the default in the 2.0.x line) please also use the -d:useMalloc switch.
This problem will be fixed in a future release, sorry for the inconvenience.
Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.0.6 or
install it as described here.

Back in Memory Allocation, I introduced Haskie.
The idea behind Haskie was to create a character that could ask questions the
reader might have, and to "soften" the posts to make them feel less
intimidating. I got some feedback from people that Haskie was a bit too
childish, and didn't feel like he belonged in posts about serious topics.
This feedback was in the minority, though, and most people liked him. So I…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I continue to streamline an arena-based paradigm, and stumbled
upon a concise technique for dynamic growth — an efficient, generic
“concatenate anything to anything” within an arena built atop a core of
9-ish lines of code. The key insight originated from a reader suggestion
about dynamic arrays. The subject of concatenation can be a string,
dynamic array, or even something else. The “system” is extensible, and
especially useful for path handling.
Continuing from last time, the examples are in light, C-style C++.
I chose it because templates and function overloading express the concepts
succinctly. It uses no standard library functionality, so converting to C,
or similar, should be straightforward. The core concatenation “operator”:

template<typename T>
T concat(arena *a, T head, T tail)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Occasionally we need to compute the size of an object that does not yet
exist, or a subscript that may fall out of bounds. It’s easy to miss
the edge cases where results overflow, creating a nasty, subtle bug, even
in the presence of type safety. Ideally such computations happen in
specialized code, such as inside an allocator (calloc, reallocarray)
and not outside by the allocatee (i.e. malloc). Mitigations exist with
different trade-offs: arbitrary precision, or using a wider fixed integer
— i.e. 128-bit integers on 64-bit hosts. In the typical case, working only
with fixed size-type integers, I’ve come up with a set of guidelines to
avoid overflows in the edge cases.
Range check before computing a result. No exceptions.
Do not cast unless you know a priori the operand is in range.
