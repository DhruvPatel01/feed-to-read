        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nim team is happy to announce Nim version 2.0.12, our sixth patch release for Nim 2.0,
for our users who haven’t switched yet to Nim 2.2.
Version 2.0.12 is a small release, containing just 24 commits, but it brings several improvements to Nim 2.0.10, released a month ago.
Installing Nim 2.0.12
If you have installed a previous version of Nim using choosenim,
getting Nim 2.0.12 is as easy as:
$ choosenim update self
$ choosenim 2.0.12

Make sure that the version of choosenim you have installed is 0.8.5 or higher, otherwise visit choosenim’s repo and see there how to re-install it first, before updating Nim.
Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.0.12 from
our nightlies builds.
