        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In C, we allocate memory on the heap using the malloc function. Other programming languages like C++ or zig (e.g., std.heap.c_allocator) may call on malloc underneath so it is important to understand how malloc works. Furthermore, the same concepts apply broadly to other memory allocators. In theory, you could allocate just one byte like so: … Continue reading How much memory does a call to ‘malloc’  allocates?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nim team is happy to announce Nim version 2.0.6, our third, and the largest by far, patch release for Nim 2.0.
Version 2.0.6 contains (exactly!) 200 commits and brings bugfixes and improvements to Nim 2.0.4, released two months ago.
The reason for this many commits in this release is that this is planned as the last 2.0.x release before Nim 2.2 and we wanted to give you the best Nim 2.0 experience in case you won’t be able to switch immediately to Nim 2.2.
NOTE: If your program uses threads (--threads:on became the default in the 2.0.x line) please also use the -d:useMalloc switch.
This problem will be fixed in a future release, sorry for the inconvenience.
Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.0.6 or
install it as described here.
