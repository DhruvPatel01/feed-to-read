        <updated>2024-11-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nim team is happy to announce Nim version 2.0.12, our sixth patch release for Nim 2.0,
for our users who haven’t switched yet to Nim 2.2.
Version 2.0.12 is a small release, containing just 24 commits, but it brings several improvements to Nim 2.0.10, released a month ago.
Installing Nim 2.0.12
If you have installed a previous version of Nim using choosenim,
getting Nim 2.0.12 is as easy as:
$ choosenim update self
$ choosenim 2.0.12

Make sure that the version of choosenim you have installed is 0.8.5 or higher, otherwise visit choosenim’s repo and see there how to re-install it first, before updating Nim.
Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.0.12 from
our nightlies builds.
Donating to Nim
We would like to encourage you to donate to Nim.
The donated money will be used to further improve Nim by creating bounties
for the most important bugfixes and features.
You can donate via:
Open Collective
Bitcoin: 1BXfuKM2uvoD6mbx4g5xM3eQhLzkCK77tJ
If you are a company, we also offer commercial support.
Bugfixes

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Windows paths have been WTF-16-encoded for decades, but module names
in the import tables of Portable Executable are octets.
If a name contains values beyond ASCII — technically out of spec — then
the dynamic linker must somehow decode those octets into Unicode in order
to construct a lookup path. There are multiple ways this could be done,
and the most obvious is the process’s active code page (ACP), which is
exactly what happens. As a consequence, the specific DLL loaded by the
linker may depend on the system code page. In this article I’ll contrive
such a situation.
LoadLibraryA is a similar situation, and potentially applies the code
page to a longer portion of the module path. LoadLibraryW is
unaffected, at least for the directly-named module, because it’s Unicode
all the way through.…]]></summary>
