        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though I have many brilliant graduate students, I love working with undergraduate students. And I am not at all sure that you should favor people with graduate degrees, given a choice. Many graduate students tend to favor abstraction over practical skills. They often have an idealized view of the world. Moreover, these students are often … Continue reading Graduate degrees are overrated]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article was discussed on Hacker News.
Over the past month I’ve been exploring the rapidly evolving world of
Large Language Models (LLM). It’s now accessible enough to run a LLM on a
Raspberry Pi smarter than the original ChatGPT (November 2022). A modest
desktop or laptop supports even smarter AI. It’s also private, offline,
unlimited, and registration-free. The technology is improving at breakneck
speed, and information is outdated in a matter of months. This article
snapshots my practical, hands-on knowledge and experiences — information I
wish I had when starting. Keep in mind that I’m a LLM layman, I have no
novel insights to share, and it’s likely I’ve misunderstood certain
aspects. In a year this article will mostly be a historical footnote,
which is simultaneously exciting and …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nim team is happy to announce Nim version 2.0.12, our sixth patch release for Nim 2.0,
for our users who haven’t switched yet to Nim 2.2.
Version 2.0.12 is a small release, containing just 24 commits, but it brings several improvements to Nim 2.0.10, released a month ago.
Installing Nim 2.0.12
If you have installed a previous version of Nim using choosenim,
getting Nim 2.0.12 is as easy as:
$ choosenim update self
$ choosenim 2.0.12

Make sure that the version of choosenim you have installed is 0.8.5 or higher, otherwise visit choosenim’s repo and see there how to re-install it first, before updating Nim.
Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.0.12 from
our nightlies builds.
Donating to Nim
We would like to encourage you to donate to Nim.
The donated money will be used to further improve Nim by creating bounties
for the most important bugfixes and features.
