written between 1990–1996. The Vim project soon adopted it, and it’s lived
there ever since. If you have Vim, you also have xxd. Its primary use
cases are (1) the basis for a hex editor due to its -r reverse option
that can unhexdump its previous output, and (2) a data embedding tool
for C and C++ (-i). The former provides Vim’s rudimentary hex editor
functionality. The second case is of special interest to w64devkit:
xxd -i appears in many builds that embed arbitrary data. It’s
important that w64devkit has a compatible implementation, and a freshly
rewritten, improved xxd, rexxd, now replaces the original xxd (as
xxd).
For those unfamiliar with xxd, examples are in order. Its default hexdump
output looks like this:

This blogpost is a preliminary of the
post on static
search trees. We will be looking into binary search and how it can be
optimized using different memory layouts (Eytzinger), branchless
techniques and careful use of prefetching. In addition, we will explore
batching. Our language of choice will be Rust.]]></summary>
