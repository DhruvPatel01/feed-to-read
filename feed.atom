        <updated>2024-07-03T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nim team is happy to announce Nim version 2.0.8, our fourth patch release for Nim 2.0.
Version 2.0.8 is a small release, containing just 20 commits, but it brings important improvements to Nim 2.0.6, released 10 days ago.
Major improvements in this release:
Nim’s allocator is now much more stable with --threads:on.
Better support for gcc14.
Optimized setLen(0) for uninitialized strings and seqs.
Optimized move when used with --mm:refc.
This release comes relatively quickly after our previous release because it was time-critical for our partner Status to receive these improvements as soon as possible.
It is our way of saying “thank you” for their continued support of Nim.
Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.0.8 or
install it as described here.
Existing users
If you have installed a previous version of Nim using choosenim,
getting Nim 2.0.8 is as easy as:
$ choosenim 2.0.8

If you are on OSX ARM, choosenim will not work for you.
Please choose an alternative method of installing or updating.
Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.0.8 from
our nightlies builds.
Donating to Nim
We would like to encourage you to donate to Nim.
The donated money will be used to further improve Nim by creating bounties
for the most important bugfixes and features.
You can donate via:
Open Collective
Bitcoin: 1BXfuKM2uvoD6mbx4g5xM3eQhLzkCK77tJ
If you are a company, we also offer commercial support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I introduced two new tools to w64devkit, vc++filt and
peports (pronounced like purports), which aid manual symbol
inspection and complement one another. As of this writing, the latter is
not yet in a release, but it’s feature-complete and trivial to build if
you wanted to try it out early. This article explains the motivation and
purpose for each.
vc++filt
Binutils has c++filt, a tool to demangle C++ symbols. Its primary use
case is operating on whole files or streams, passing through anything that
doesn’t look like a mangled C++ symbol, and interpolating human-friendly
names in place of mangled symbols. In, say, Vim I could run the current
buffer through it to translate mangled symbols (:%!c++filt).
Otherwise it’s often composed with other tools in a pipeline.

Version 2.0.6 contains (exactly!) 200 commits and brings bugfixes and improvements to Nim 2.0.4, released two months ago.
The reason for this many commits in this release is that this is planned as the last 2.0.x release before Nim 2.2 and we wanted to give you the best Nim 2.0 experience in case you won’t be able to switch immediately to Nim 2.2.
NOTE: If your program uses threads (--threads:on became the default in the 2.0.x line) please also use the -d:useMalloc switch.
This problem will be fixed in a future release, sorry for the inconvenience.
