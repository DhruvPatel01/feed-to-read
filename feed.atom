Even though we can already find some articles about how search engine work from a high level, it could be interesting to implement our own and add some constraints to make it fun (and maybe simpler).
The Challenge
Most search engine implementations you'll find online target the server-side. They're great for large-scale applications but don't address the unique challenges of building a search engine that runs directly in your browser, your mobile app or in a desktop app. That's exactly what we're going to tackle: creating a client-side search engine that works seamlessly across platforms.

This is a small survey on MinHash-based sketching methods, to go along with my
simd-sketch crate (github, crates.io, docs.rs). See also Cohen (2014) for a previous
small survey.
Goal. SimdSketch should be fast. It is and should remain a conceptually
simple tool, that prefers fast implementations of simple ideas over complex ideas.
For now, it works well for the simple case of relatively high identity
sequences. I may implement more algorithmic variants, but also the API should
remain concise.]]></summary>

all edges are directed towards the right.

The goal is now to store all edges / k-mers of the graph efficiently.
A spectrum preserving string set (SPSS) is a set of strings whose k-mers are
the k-mers of the input graph, that does not contain duplicate k-mers (Rahman and Medvedev 2020).]]></summary>

yesterday, with a neat demonstration of OpenBSD’s pinsyscall
security feature, whereby only pre-registered addresses are allowed to
make system calls. Whether it strengthens or weakens security is up for
debate, but regardless it’s an interesting, low-level programming
challenge. The original demo is fragile for multiple reasons, and requires
manually locating and entering addresses for each build. In this article I
show how to fix it. To prove that it’s robust, I ported an entire, real
application to use raw system calls on OpenBSD.
The original program uses ARM64 assembly. I’m a lot more comfortable with
x86-64 assembly, plus that’s the hardware I have readily on hand. So the
assembly language will be different, but all the con…]]></summary>

widely supported by modeling software, easy to parse, and trivial to emit,
much like Netpbm for 2D image data. Poke around hobby 3D graphics
projects and you’re likely to find a bespoke OBJ parser. While typically
only loading their own model data, so robustness doesn’t much matter, they
usually have hard limitations and don’t stand up to fuzz testing.
This article presents a robust, partial OBJ parser in C with no hard-coded
limitations, written from scratch. Like similar articles, it’s not
really about OBJ but demonstrating some techniques you’ve probably never
seen before.
