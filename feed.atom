        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nim team is happy to announce two releases:
the latest Nim, version 2.0.2
LTS release, version 1.6.18
For the majority of our users, v2.0.2 contains 63 commits and brings bugfixes and improvements to Nim 2.0.0, released four months ago.
NOTE: If your program uses threads (--threads:on became the default in the 2.0.x line) please also use the -d:useMalloc switch.
This problem will be fixed in 2.0.4, sorry for the inconvenience.
For those users who haven’t switched to Nim v2.0 yet, we have released the ninth patch release for Nim 1.6.x.
It is a small release with 13 commits.
Nim Community Survey 2023
Before going into details of the release, we would like to remind you that 2023 Nim Community Survey is still open, and we would appreciate your input if you haven’t done it already.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article was discussed on Hacker News and on reddit.
Users of mature C libraries conventionally get to choose how memory is
allocated — that is, when it cannot be avoided entirely. The C
standard never laid down a convention — perhaps for the better —
so each library re-invents an allocator interface. Not all are created
equal, and most repeat a few fundamental mistakes. Often the interface is
merely a token effort, to check off that it’s “supported” without actual
consideration to its use. This article describes the critical features of
a practical allocator interface, and demonstrates why they’re important.
Before diving into the details, here’s the checklist for library authors:
All allocation functions accept a user-defined context pointer.

Humans
To understand the good parts, first we have to start with humans. Humans
have emotions, and those emotions are what they mostly use when asked to
rate things on a 10-point scale.
Almost exactly twenty years ago, I wrote about sitting on a plane next to a
musician who told me about music album reviews. The worst
rating an artist can receive, he said, is a lukewarm one. If people think
your music is neutral, it means you didn't make them feel anything at all.
You failed. Someone might buy music that reviewers hate, or buy music that
people love, but they aren't really that interested in music that is just
