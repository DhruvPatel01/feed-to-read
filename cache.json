          "description": "I introduced two new tools to w64devkit, vc++filt and\npeports (pronounced like purports), which aid manual symbol\ninspection and complement one another. As of this writing, the latter is\nnot yet in a release, but it’s feature-complete and trivial to build if\nyou wanted to try it out early. This article explains the motivation and\npurpose for each.\nvc++filt\nBinutils has c++filt, a tool to demangle C++ symbols. Its primary use\ncase is operating on whole files or streams, passing through anything that\ndoesn’t look like a mangled C++ symbol, and interpolating human-friendly\nnames in place of mangled symbols. In, say, Vim I could run the current\nbuffer through it to translate mangled symbols (:%!c++filt).\nOtherwise it’s often composed with other tools in a pipeline.\nFor example, suppose I want …",
