          "description": "This article was discussed on Hacker News and on reddit.\nThis has been a ground-breaking year for my C skills, and paradigm shifts\nin my technique has provoked me to reconsider my habits and coding style.\nIt’s been my largest personal style change in years, so I’ve decided to\ntake a snapshot of its current state and my reasoning. These changes have\nproduced significant productive and organizational benefits, so while most\nis certainly subjective, it likely includes a few objective improvements.\nI’m not saying everyone should write C this way, and when I contribute\ncode to a project I follow their local style. This is about what works\nwell for me.\nPrimitive types\nStarting with the fundamentals, I’ve been using short names for primitive\ntypes. The resulting clarity was more than I had expect…",

          "description": "Previously I presented an arena-friendly hash map applicable to any\nprogramming language where one might use arena allocation. In this third\narticle I present a generic, arena-backed dynamic array. The details are\nspecific to C, as the most appropriate mechanism depends on the language\n(e.g. templates, generics). Just as in the previous two articles, the goal\nis to demonstrate an idea so simple that a full implementation fits on one\nterminal pager screen — a concept rather than a library.\nUnlike a hash map or linked list, a dynamic array — a data buffer with a\nsize that varies during run time — is more difficult to square with arena\nallocation. They’re contiguous by definition, and we cannot resize objects\nin the middle of an arena, i.e. realloc. So while convenient, they come\nwith trade-o…",

In addition, they’re fast, simple,\nand automatically scale to any problem that could reasonably be solved\nwith an in-memory hash map. To avoid resizing — both to better support\narenas and to simplify implementation — they have slightly above average\nmemory requirements. The design, which we’re calling a hash-trie, is the\nresult of fruitful collaboration with NRK, whose sibling article\nincludes benchmarks. It’s my new favorite data structure, and has proven\nincredibly useful. With a couple well-placed acquire/release atomics, we\ncan even turn it into a lock-free concurrent hash map.\nI’ve written before about MSI hash tables, …",

          "description": "This article was discussed on Hacker News.\nOver the past year I’ve refined my approach to arena allocation.\nWith practice, it’s effective, simple, and fast; typically as easy to use\nas garbage collection but without the costs. Depending on need, an\nallocator can weigh just 7–25 lines of code — perfect when lacking a\nruntime. With the core details of my own technique settled, now is a\ngood time to document and share lessons learned. This is certainly not the\nonly way to approach arena allocation, but these are practices I’ve worked\nout to simplify programs and reduce mistakes.\nAn arena is a memory buffer and an offset into that buffer, initially\nzero. To allocate an object, grab a pointer at the offset, advance the\noffset by the size of the object, and return the pointer. There’s a little\nm…",

Instead, I look at what I see, try to match it to something inside my mental model, and then let the mental model extrapolate what “should” happen from there.\nIf this sounds predictably error prone: yes.
