          "description": "I came across a question: How does one efficiently solve Two Sum in C?\nThere’s a naive quadratic time solution, but also an amortized linear time\nsolution using a hash table. Without a built-in or standard library hash\ntable, the latter sounds onerous. However, a mask-step-index table,\na hash table construction suitable for many problems, requires only a few\nlines of code. This approach is useful even when a standard hash table is\navailable, because by exploiting the known problem constraints, it\nbeats typical generic hash table performance by 1–2 orders of magnitude\n(demo).\nThe Two Sum exercise, restated:\nGiven an integer array and target, return the distinct indices of two\nelements that sum to the target.\nIn particular, the solution doesn’t find elements, but their indices. The\nexercise …",

I absolutely loved some of these plays and performances,\nand so I’d like to highlight them, especially because my favorites are,\nwith one exception, not “popular” plays.

All performances were either a\nrecording of a live stage or an adaptation, so they’re also available to\nyou if you’re interested, though in most cases not for free.
