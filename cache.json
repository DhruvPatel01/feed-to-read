          "description": "Fuzz testing is incredibly effective for mechanically discovering software\ndefects, yet remains underused and neglected. Pick any program that must\ngracefully accept complex input, written in any language, which has not\nyet been been fuzzed, and fuzz testing usually reveals at least one bug.\nAt least one program currently installed on your own computer certainly\nqualifies. Perhaps even most of them. Everything is broken and\nlow-hanging fruit is everywhere. After fuzz testing ~1,000 projects over\nthe past six years, I’ve accumulated tips for picking that fruit.\nThe checklist format has worked well in the past (1, 2), so\nI’ll use it again. This article discusses AFL++ on source-available\nC and C++ targets, running on glibc-based Linux distributions, currently\nthe best fuzzing platform for C …",

The\ncore, important features of these data structures require only a dozen or\nso lines of code apiece. They compile quickly, and tend to run faster in\ndebug builds than release builds of their C++ equivalents. What they\nlack in genericity they compensate in simplicity. Nothing here will be\nnew.
