The key insight originated from a reader suggestion\nabout dynamic arrays. The subject of concatenation can be a string,\ndynamic array, or even something else. The ‚Äúsystem‚Äù is extensible, and\nespecially useful for path handling.\nContinuing from last time, the examples are in light, C-style C++.\nI chose it because templates and function overloading express the concepts\nsuccinctly. It uses no standard library functionality, so converting to C,\nor similar, should be straightforward. The core concatenation ‚Äúoperator‚Äù:\n\ntemplate<typename T>\nT concat(arena *a, T head, T tail)\n‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Occasionally we need to compute the size of an object that does not yet\nexist, or a subscript that may fall out of bounds. It‚Äôs easy to miss\nthe edge cases where results overflow, creating a nasty, subtle bug, even\nin the presence of type safety. Ideally such computations happen in\nspecialized code, such as inside an allocator (calloc, reallocarray)\nand not outside by the allocatee (i.e. malloc). Mitigations exist with\ndifferent trade-offs: arbitrary precision, or using a wider fixed integer\n‚Äî i.e. 128-bit integers on 64-bit hosts. In the typical case, working only\nwith fixed size-type integers, I‚Äôve come up with a set of guidelines to\navoid overflows in the edge cases.\nRange check before computing a result.
