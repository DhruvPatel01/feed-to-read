It’s now accessible enough to run a LLM on a\nRaspberry Pi smarter than the original ChatGPT (November 2022). A modest\ndesktop or laptop supports even smarter AI. It’s also private, offline,\nunlimited, and registration-free. The technology is improving at breakneck\nspeed, and information is outdated in a matter of months. This article\nsnapshots my practical, hands-on knowledge and experiences — information I\nwish I had when starting. Keep in mind that I’m a LLM layman, I have no\nnovel insights to share, and it’s likely I’ve misunderstood certain\naspects.
