          "description": "This article was discussed on Hacker News and on reddit.\nUsers of mature C libraries conventionally get to choose how memory is\nallocated — that is, when it cannot be avoided entirely. The C\nstandard never laid down a convention — perhaps for the better —\nso each library re-invents an allocator interface. Not all are created\nequal, and most repeat a few fundamental mistakes. Often the interface is\nmerely a token effort, to check off that it’s “supported” without actual\nconsideration to its use. This article describes the critical features of\na practical allocator interface, and demonstrates why they’re important.\nBefore diving into the details, here’s the checklist for library authors:\nAll allocation functions accept a user-defined context pointer.\nThe “free” function accepts the original …",
