          "description": "I’ve been reading Math Games with Bad Drawings, a great book\nwell-aligned to my interests. It’s given me a lot of new, interesting\nprogramming puzzles to consider. The first to truly nerd snipe me was\nDandelions (full rules), an asymmetric paper-and-pencil game\ninvented by the book’s author, Ben Orlin. Just as with British Square two\nyears ago — and essentially following the same technique — I wrote a\nprogram that explores the game tree sufficiently to play either side\nperfectly, “solving” the game in its standard 5-by-5 configuration.\nThe source: dandelions.c\nThe game is played on a 5-by-5 grid where one player plays the dandelions,\nthe other plays the wind. Players alternate, dandelions placing flowers\nand wind blowing in one of the eight directions, spreading seeds from all\nflowers alon…",
