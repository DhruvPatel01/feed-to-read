Many are ensnared in\nits traps, usually unknowingly. As such, the asm keyword is essentially\nthe unsafe keyword of C and C++. Nearly every inline assembly tutorial,\nincluding the awful ibilio page at the top of search engines for\ndecades, propagate fundamental, serious mistakes, and most examples are\nincorrect. The dangerous part is that the examples usually produce the\nexpected results! The situation is dire. This article isn’t a tutorial,\nbut basic rules to avoid the most common mistakes, or to spot them in code\nreview.\nThe focus is entirely extended assembly, and not basic assembly,\nwhich has different rules.

          "description": "<p>A special <em>Haskell</em> edition of some interesting articles I recently read on the internet, starting\nwith some Haskell-in-practice articles:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>I like this new trend of making scripting dialects of full-fledged programming languages. Joining the\nlikes of <a href=\"https://babashka.org/\">Babashka</a> and <a href=\"https://horstmann.com/unblog/2024-12-11/index.html\">Small Java</a>\nis <a href=\"https://chrisdone.com/posts/hell/\">Hell, a Shell scripting Haskell dialect</a> by Chris Done.\nI usually write my scripts in Python, but I sorely miss static typing and functional programming, so naturally, I’m excited for Hell.\nIt is in a nascent stage now, but hopefully, it will grow into something nice and usable.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Many think that Haskell is too complex for real-world projects. I really like this solid\nadvice by Patrick Thomson for putting Haskell in real-world use:\n<a href=\"https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/fast-iteration-with-haskell.html\">Towards Faster Iteration in Industrial Haskell</a>,\nwhere he writes about Haskell editors and tooling, GHC extensions, type system, building, and deployment.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Haskell is one of the few programming languages that are lazy by default, and often this is a source of\na lot of headaches for programmers, causing space leaks, slow computation, or hard to debug stack traces. But\nsometimes laziness can be harnessed for writing better programs, like Jasper Van der Jeugt does\nto create an efficient and elegant layout algorithm for creating photo collages in\n<a href=\"https://jaspervdj.be/posts/2023-07-22-lazy-layout.html\">Lazy Layout</a>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>I love it when people use advanced programming techniques to solve their day-to-day problems! In\n<a href=\"https://alt-romes.github.io/posts/2024-08-14-planning-a-workout-week-with-100-lines-of-haskell.html\">Planning Weekly Workouts in 100 Lines of Haskell</a>,\nRodrigo Mesquita uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming\">Logic Programming</a> in Haskell\nto create a custom workout plan for themselves.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>For some unknown reasons, functional programming and music seem to mesh well together. Maybe it is\nbecause both have combinatorial and compositional natures. In <a href=\"https://blog.fmap.fr/posts/karplus-strong-sound-synthesis.html\">Cheap Guitars and Drums in Haskell</a>,\nAlp Mestanogullari uses Haskell to do digital audio synthesis by implementing the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karplus%E2%80%93Strong_string_synthesis\">Karplus-Strong algorithm</a>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Another interesting use of Haskell to solve problems in clean and interesting way: Vehbi Sinan Tunalioglu\nuses the Diagrams library to generate dynamic <a href=\"https://ogp.me/\">OpenGraph</a> preview image for their website pages as detailed in\n<a href=\"https://thenegation.com/posts/haskell-diagrams-dynamic-og/\">More Haskell Diagrams: Dynamic OpenGraph Images</a>.\nCurrently I do this for my website in the crudest way possible: open the page in a browser manually\nand save a screenshot. Naturally, I end up doing it only once per page and the previews are not dynamic.\nI plan to switch to using Vehbi’s technique in future.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Moving on to some Haskell-for-fun articles:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Water Sort is a puzzle game where you have to sort coloured water into bottles. In <a href=\"https://nicaudinet.github.io/2024/10/14/watersort-haskell/\">Water Sort in Haskell</a>\nNicolas Audinet de Pieuchon creates the game as a terminal UI in Haskell using <a href=\"https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/\">the Elm architecture</a>.\nI like how Haskell and functional programming make writing and understanding such software easy by\ncleanly separating the game logic and the rendering logic.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>I’ve done <a href=\"https://adventofcode.com\">Avdent of Code</a> in Haskell for a couple of years now, and that has made me quite interested\nin efficient and convenient data structures in Haskell. Brent Yorgey has written about a bunch of them in\ntheir <a href=\"https://byorgey.github.io/blog/tag/challenge.html\">Competitive Programming in Haskell</a> series, and the latest article is about efficiently\ncalculating a measure for sliding windows of lists: <a href=\"https://byorgey.github.io/blog/posts/2024/11/27/stacks-queues.html\">Stacks, Queues, and Monoidal Sliding Windows</a>.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Next, some Haskell concepts articles:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Haskell is notorious as a hard to learn language and I think some of that ill fame in deserved. Because\nof a powerful and flexible type-system, Haskell lets users solve their problems in many different ways,\nsome of which could be too obtuse for many to understand.\n<a href=\"https://blog.jle.im/entry/levels-of-type-safety-haskell-lists.html\">Seven Levels of Type Safety in Haskell: Lists</a>\nby Justin Le shows seven different ways of working with lists in Haskell, only one of which is\nwhat we know as List (<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">[a]</code>) in usual Haskell. It’s still fun to learn about these, and who knows,\nsome of them may come handy some day.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fix</code> is one of those clever Haskell things that are very cool and terse but take a while to understand.\nIn <a href=\"https://gilmi.me/blog/post/2021/03/11/fix-by-example\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fix</code> by Example</a> Gil Mizrahi explains how it\nworks by providing motivating examples. But to be honest, I took me quite some tries to <strong>get</strong> it even\nafter reading a bunch about it.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>Arrows are a part of Haskell that I don’t much understand, or use. Haskell even has <a href=\"https://www.haskell.org/arrows/syntax.html\">special syntax</a> for\nthem. In <a href=\"https://langdev.stackexchange.com/revisions/2372/2\">Why Arrows?</a> <a href=\"https://lexi-lambda.github.io/\">Alexis King</a>\nexplains why we need arrows at all. Instead of commenting on it, I’m gonna quote a part:\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>The key insight behind arrows comes from the following observation: it’s impossible to analyze the\nstructure of a monadic function <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">a -&gt; m b</code> without applying it because functions are opaque—the only\nthing we can do with one is apply it. Instead, we need to build our computation out of “function-like values”\nthat are not opaque—we must be able to do more than just apply them.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Here is an interesting use of a rather complicated concept from Category Theory: MangoIV shows in\n<a href=\"https://mangoiv.com/posts/2024-11-23-codensity.html\">Codensity for Resource Management</a> a way to\nuse the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codensity_monad\">Codensity monad</a> for conveniently managing\nresources in Haskell code.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>If you have read any Haskell code, you’d know that Haskellers love writing terse code (myself included).\nThat includes using a lot of single-letter variable names, which may make the code very unreadable for an\nunacquainted eye. But there is a method to this madness, and Jack Kelly captures a comprehensive knowledge\nabout such names in <a href=\"http://jackkelly.name/blog/archives/2024/10/12/a_dictionary_of_single-letter_variable_names/index.html\">A Dictionary of Single-Letter Variable Names</a>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>Stephen Diehl writes a thorough tutorial about how to generate X86 assembly from scratch for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation\">JIT compilation</a>,\nand how to make it easy by exploiting a monadic interface\nin <a href=\"https://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/monads_machine_code/\">Monads to Machine Code</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Finally, some Haskell philosophy to finish it off:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Adam Dueck muses “<a href=\"https://adueck.github.io/blog/on-haskell-jazz-and-pure-math/\">Why Does Everyone Hate Haskell, Jazz, and Pure Math?</a>”,\nand posits that exploring interesting things that may not be immediately useful may actually cause\nmore practical advances in the long term.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That’s it for this year. Have a happy and prosperous 2025!</p>\n\n<p>Like, share, or comment on this post on <a href=\"https://fantastic.earth/@abnv/113748806936137827\" class=\"mastodon-link\">Mastodon</a>.</p>",
