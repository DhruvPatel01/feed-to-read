E.g., “3.1416” could be parsed as a number close to pi. However strings typically cannot be represented exactly or at all. For example, “1e-1000” is too small and “1e1000” is too large for even 64-bit floating-point … Continue reading Parsing tiny and very large floating-point values: a programming-language comparison",
