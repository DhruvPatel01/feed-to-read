          "description": "Ted Unangst published dude, where are your syscalls? on flak\nyesterday, with a neat demonstration of OpenBSD’s pinsyscall\nsecurity feature, whereby only pre-registered addresses are allowed to\nmake system calls. Whether it strengthens or weakens security is up for\ndebate, but regardless it’s an interesting, low-level programming\nchallenge. The original demo is fragile for multiple reasons, and requires\nmanually locating and entering addresses for each build. In this article I\nshow how to fix it. To prove that it’s robust, I ported an entire, real\napplication to use raw system calls on OpenBSD.\nThe original program uses ARM64 assembly. I’m a lot more comfortable with\nx86-64 assembly, plus that’s the hardware I have readily on hand. So the\nassembly language will be different, but all the con…",

          "description": "Wavefront OBJ is a line-oriented, text format for 3D geometry. It’s\nwidely supported by modeling software, easy to parse, and trivial to emit,\nmuch like Netpbm for 2D image data. Poke around hobby 3D graphics\nprojects and you’re likely to find a bespoke OBJ parser. While typically\nonly loading their own model data, so robustness doesn’t much matter, they\nusually have hard limitations and don’t stand up to fuzz testing.\nThis article presents a robust, partial OBJ parser in C with no hard-coded\nlimitations, written from scratch. Like similar articles, it’s not\nreally about OBJ but demonstrating some techniques you’ve probably never\nseen before.\nIf you’d like to see the ready-to-run full source: objrender.c.\nAll images are screenshots of this program.\nFirst let’s establish the requirements.

          "description": "xxd is a versatile hexdump utility with a “reverse” feature, originally\nwritten between 1990–1996. The Vim project soon adopted it, and it’s lived\nthere ever since. If you have Vim, you also have xxd. Its primary use\ncases are (1) the basis for a hex editor due to its -r reverse option\nthat can unhexdump its previous output, and (2) a data embedding tool\nfor C and C++ (-i). The former provides Vim’s rudimentary hex editor\nfunctionality. The second case is of special interest to w64devkit:\nxxd -i appears in many builds that embed arbitrary data. It’s\nimportant that w64devkit has a compatible implementation, and a freshly\nrewritten, improved xxd, rexxd, now replaces the original xxd (as\nxxd).\nFor those unfamiliar with xxd, examples are in order. Its default hexdump\noutput looks like this:\n\n$…",
