          "description": "I came across a question: How does one efficiently solve Two Sum in C?\nThere’s a naive quadratic time solution, but also an amortized linear time\nsolution using a hash table. Without a built-in or standard library hash\ntable, the latter sounds onerous. However, a mask-step-index table,\na hash table construction suitable for many problems, requires only a few\nlines of code. This approach is useful even when a standard hash table is\navailable, because by exploiting the known problem constraints, it\nbeats typical generic hash table performance by 1–2 orders of magnitude\n(demo).\nThe Two Sum exercise, restated:\nGiven an integer array and target, return the distinct indices of two\nelements that sum to the target.\nIn particular, the solution doesn’t find elements, but their indices. The\nexercise …",

I’ve reached my goal and,\nthough it’s not a usual topic around here, I wanted to get my thoughts\ndown while fresh. I absolutely loved some of these plays and performances,\nand so I’d like to highlight them, especially because my favorites are,\nwith one exception, not “popular” plays. Per tradition, I begin with my\nleast enjoyed plays and work my way up. All performances were either a\nrecording of a live stage or an adaptation, so they’re also available to\nyou if you’re interested, though in most cases not for free.
