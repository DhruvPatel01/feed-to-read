While considering\nit, I also came up with a novel, or at least unconventional, solution. The\nproblem is to deep copy a linked list where each node references a random\nlist element in addition to usual linkage ‚Äî similar to LeetCode problem\n138. This reference is one of identity rather than value, which has\nmurky consequences.\n\ntypedef struct node node;\nstruct node {\n    node *next;\n    node *ref;   // arbitrary node in the list, or null\n};\n\nnode *deepcopy(node *);\n\n\nIn the copy, nodes have individual lifetimes allocated using malloc\nwhich the caller is responsible for freeing.
