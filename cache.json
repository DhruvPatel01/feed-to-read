This header has an enormous\nnumber of definitions and declarations and so, for C programs, it tends to\ndominate the build time of those translation units. Most programs,\nespecially systems software, only needs a tiny portion of it. For example,\nwhen compiling u-config with GCC, two thirds of the debug build was\nspent processing windows.h just for 4 types, 16 definitions, and 16\nprototypes.\nTo give a sense of the numbers, here’s empty.c, which does nothing but\ninclude windows.h.\n\n#include <windows.h>\n\n\nWith the current Mingw-w64 headers, that’s ~82kLOC (non-blank):\n\n$ gcc -E empty.c | grep -vc '^$'\n82041\n\n\nWith w64devkit this takes my system ~450ms to compile with GCC:\n\n$ tim…",
