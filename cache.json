          "description": "For the typical DLL function call you declare the function prototype (via\nheader file), you inform the link editor (ld, link) that the DLL\nexports a symbol with that name (import library), it matches the declared\nname with this export, and it becomes an import in your program’s import\ntable. What happens when two different DLLs export the same symbol? The\nlink editor will pick the first found. But what if you want to use both\nexports? If they have the same name, how could program or link editor\ndistinguish them? In this article I’ll demonstrate a technique to resolve\nthis by creating a program which links with and directly uses two\ndifferent C runtimes (CRTs) simultaneously.\nIn PE executable images, an import isn’t just a symbol, but a tuple\nof DLL name and symbol. For human display, a tup…",

          "description": "In an effort to avoid programming by superstition, I did a deep dive\ninto the Win32 “environment block,” the data structure holding a process’s\nenvironment variables, in order to better understand it. Along the way I\ndiscovered implied and undocumented behaviors. (The environment block\nmust not to be confused with the Process Environment Block (PEB)\nwhich is different.) Because I cannot possibly retain all the quirky\ndetails in my head for long, I’m writing them down for future reference. I\nran my tests on different Windows versions as far back as Windows XP SP3\nin order to fill in gaps where documentation is ambiguous, incomplete, or\nwrong. Overall conclusion: Correct, direct manipulation of an environment\nblock is impossible in the general case due to under-specified and\nincorrect docume…",
