I’m always looking for a better way, and lately I’ve\nbeen experimenting with building them using C++ features. What are the\ntrade-offs? Are the benefits worth the costs? In this article I lay out my\ngoals, review implementation possibilities, and discuss my findings.\nFollowing along will require familiarity with those previous two articles.\nSome of C++ is beyond my mental capabilities, and so I cannot wield those\nparts effectively. Other parts I can wrap my head around, but it\nrequires substantial effort and the inevitable mistakes are difficult to\ndebug. So a general goal is to minimize contact with that complexity, only\ntouching a few higher-value features that I can use confidently.\nExisting practice is unimportant. …",
