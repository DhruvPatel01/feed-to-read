          "description": "If you’ve spent much time developing with Mingw-w64 you’ve likely seen the\nsymbol ___chkstk_ms, perhaps in an error message. It’s a little piece of\nruntime provided by GCC via libgcc which ensures enough of the stack is\ncommitted for the caller’s stack frame. The “function” uses a custom ABI\nand is implemented in assembly. So is the subject of this article, a\nslightly improved implementation soon to be included in w64devkit as\nlibchkstk (-lchkstk).\nThe MSVC toolchain has an identical (x64) or similar (x86) function named\n__chkstk. We’ll discuss that as well, and w64devkit will include x86 and\nx64 implementations, useful when linking with MSVC object files. The new\nx86 __chkstk in particular is also better than the MSVC definition.\nA note on spelling: ___chkstk_ms is spelled with three unde…",

I figured these out on my own, and I’ve not\nseen either discussed elsewhere, so I really ought to share them.\nContinuable assertions\nThe assert macro in typical C implementations leaves a lot to be\ndesired, as does raise and abort, so I’ve suggested\nalternative definitions that behave better under debuggers:\n\n#define assert(c)  while (!(c)) __builtin_trap()\n#define assert(c)  while (!(c)) __builtin_unreachable()\n#define assert(c)  while (!(c)) *(volatile int *)0 = 0\n\n\nEach serves a slightly different purpose but still has the most\nimportant property: Immediately halt the program directly on the defect.\nNone have an occasionally useful secondary property: Optionally allow the\nprogram to co…",
