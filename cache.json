          "description": "The Nim team is happy to announce Nim version 2.0.12, our sixth patch release for Nim 2.0,\nfor our users who haven’t switched yet to Nim 2.2.\nVersion 2.0.12 is a small release, containing just 24 commits, but it brings several improvements to Nim 2.0.10, released a month ago.\nInstalling Nim 2.0.12\nIf you have installed a previous version of Nim using choosenim,\ngetting Nim 2.0.12 is as easy as:\n$ choosenim update self\n$ choosenim 2.0.12\n\nMake sure that the version of choosenim you have installed is 0.8.5 or higher, otherwise visit choosenim’s repo and see there how to re-install it first, before updating Nim.\nAlternatively, you can download Nim 2.0.12 from\nour nightlies builds.\nDonating to Nim\nWe would like to encourage you to donate to Nim.\nThe donated money will be used to further improve Nim by creating bounties\nfor the most important bugfixes and features.\nYou can donate via:\nOpen Collective\nBitcoin: 1BXfuKM2uvoD6mbx4g5xM3eQhLzkCK77tJ\nIf you are a company, we also offer commercial support.\nBugfixes\nThese reported issues were fixed:\nFixed “dist/checksums wrong type: preventing build_all.sh”\n(#24173)\nFixed “Regression: compiler crash on static inference”\n(#23755)\nFixed “Regression: Error: fatal error: invalid kind for lastOrd(tyGenericParam)”\n(#23823)\nFixed “compiler crash on len of varargs[untyped]”\n(#24258)\nFixed “Error: VM problem: dest register is not set with const-bound proc”\n(#24359)\nFixed “Returning address of constant array emits invalid C code”\n(#22389)\nFixed “SIGSEGV with nim c -c and nim e on macro w(): untyped = result = genSym(nskType)”\n(#24379)\nThe complete list of changes is available\nhere.",
