          "description": "This article was discussed on Hacker News and on reddit.\nThis has been a ground-breaking year for my C skills, and paradigm shifts\nin my technique has provoked me to reconsider my habits and coding style.\nIt’s been my largest personal style change in years, so I’ve decided to\ntake a snapshot of its current state and my reasoning. These changes have\nproduced significant productive and organizational benefits, so while most\nis certainly subjective, it likely includes a few objective improvements.\nI’m not saying everyone should write C this way, and when I contribute\ncode to a project I follow their local style. This is about what works\nwell for me.\nPrimitive types\nStarting with the fundamentals, I’ve been using short names for primitive\ntypes. The resulting clarity was more than I had expect…",

          "description": "Previously I presented an arena-friendly hash map applicable to any\nprogramming language where one might use arena allocation. In this third\narticle I present a generic, arena-backed dynamic array. The details are\nspecific to C, as the most appropriate mechanism depends on the language\n(e.g. templates, generics). Just as in the previous two articles, the goal\nis to demonstrate an idea so simple that a full implementation fits on one\nterminal pager screen — a concept rather than a library.\nUnlike a hash map or linked list, a dynamic array — a data buffer with a\nsize that varies during run time — is more difficult to square with arena\nallocation. They’re contiguous by definition, and we cannot resize objects\nin the middle of an arena, i.e. realloc. So while convenient, they come\nwith trade-o…",

In addition, they’re fast, simple,\nand automatically scale to any problem that could reasonably be solved\nwith an in-memory hash map. To avoid resizing — both to better support\narenas and to simplify implementation — they have slightly above average\nmemory requirements. The design, which we’re calling a hash-trie, is the\nresult of fruitful collaboration with NRK, whose sibling article\nincludes benchmarks. It’s my new favorite data structure, and has proven\nincredibly useful.
