          "description": "Suppose you’re working in C using one of the major toolchains — that is,\nit’s mainly a C++ implementation — and you need regular expressions. You\ncould integrate a library, but there’s a regex implementation in the C++\nstandard library included with your compiler, just within reach. As a\nresourceful engineer, using an asset already in hand seems prudent. But\nit’s a C++ interface, and you’re using C instead of C++ for a reason,\nperhaps to avoid dealing with C++. Have no worries. This article is\nabout wrapping std::regex in a tidy C interface which not only\nhides all the C++ machinery, but utterly tames it. It’s not so much\npractical as a potpourri of interesting techniques.\nIf you’d like to skip ahead, here’s the full source up front. Tested with\nw64devkit, MSVC cl, and clang-cl: scratch/re…",
